Hello! Welcome to my homepage.

I am a graduate student at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, working toward my Ph.D. degree in the Department of Electrical Engineering & Computer Science. I am a member of the Energy Efficient Circuits & Systems Group supervised by Prof. Anantha P. Chandrakasan, and my research involves efficient implementation of cryptographic hardware and security protocols.

I received my B.Tech. degree in Electronics & Electrical Communication Engineering in 2013 from IIT Kharagpur (Kharagpur, India), and my S.M. degree in Electrical Engineering & Computer Science in 2017 from MIT (Cambridge, USA). From 2013 to 2015, I was with the Low Power SoC Design team at Qualcomm (Bangalore, India), where I was involved in the design of power management architectures for next-generation Snapdragon mobile processors.

I was awarded the President of India Gold Medal in 2013, the Irwin Mark Jacobs & Joan Klein Jacobs MIT Presidential Fellowship in 2015, and the Qualcomm Innovation Fellowship in 2016.
