# Utsav Banerjee

I am an Assistant Professor in the <a href="https://dese.iisc.ac.in" style="color:#0645AD;">Department of Electronic Systems Engineering</a> (within the <a href="https://eecs.iisc.ac.in" style="color:#0645AD;">Division of Electrical Electronic and Computer Sciences</a>) at <a href="https://www.iisc.ac.in" style="color:#0645AD;">Indian Institute of Science</a>, where I lead the <a href="https://labs.dese.iisc.ac.in/sinesyslab" style="color:#0645AD;">Secure Intelligent and Efficient Systems</a> (SINESys) research group. My research interests include cryptography, hardware security, digital circuits and embedded systems.


I received my B.Tech. degree in <a href="http://www.ecdept.iitkgp.ac.in" style="color:#0645AD;">Electronics & Electrical Communication Engineering</a> from <a href="http://www.iitkgp.ac.in" style="color:#0645AD;">Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur</a> (Kharagpur, WB, India) in 2013, and my S.M. and Ph.D. degrees in <a href="https://www.eecs.mit.edu" style="color:#0645AD;">Electrical Engineering & Computer Science</a> from <a href="https://www.mit.edu" style="color:#0645AD;">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a> (Cambridge, MA, USA) in 2017 and 2021 respectively.

During my S.M. and Ph.D. at MIT, I was extremely fortunate to have been a member of the <a href="https://mtlsites.mit.edu/researchgroups/icsystems" style="color:#0645AD;">Energy Efficient Circuits & Systems Group</a> supervised by <a href="https://chandrakasan.mit.edu" style="color:#0645AD;">Prof. Anantha P. Chandrakasan</a>. My Ph.D. thesis is titled "Efficient Algorithms, Protocols and Hardware Architectures for Next-Generation Cryptography in Embedded Systems".

From 2013 to 2015, I was with the Low Power SoC Design team at <a href="https://www.qualcomm.com" style="color:#0645AD;">Qualcomm</a> (Bengaluru, KA, India), where I was involved in the design and validation of power management architectures for next-generation Snapdragon mobile processors.

I was awarded the President of India Gold Medal in 2013, the Irwin Mark Jacobs & Joan Klein Jacobs MIT Presidential Fellowship in 2015, and the Qualcomm Innovation Fellowship in 2016.
