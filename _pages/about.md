Hello! Welcome to my homepage.

I am a Ph.D. candidate in the <a href="https://www.eecs.mit.edu" style="color:#0645AD;">Department of Electrical Engineering & Computer Science</a> at <a href="https://www.mit.edu" style="color:#0645AD;">Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)</a>. I am a member of the <a href="http://www-mtl.mit.edu/researchgroups/icsystems" style="color:#0645AD;">Energy Efficient Circuits & Systems Group</a> supervised by <a href="https://mtlsites.mit.edu/users/anantha" style="color:#0645AD;">Prof. Anantha P. Chandrakasan</a>, and my current research involves efficient side-channel-secure cryptographic hardware implementations, algorithm-architecture optimizations and security protocols.

I received my B.Tech. degree in Electronics & Electrical Communication Engineering in 2013 from IIT Kharagpur (Kharagpur, WB, India), and my S.M. degree in Electrical Engineering & Computer Science in 2017 from MIT (Cambridge, MA, USA). From 2013 to 2015, I was with the Low Power SoC Design team at Qualcomm (Bangalore, India), where I was involved in the design of power management architectures for next-generation Snapdragon mobile processors.

I was awarded the President of India Gold Medal in 2013, the Irwin Mark Jacobs & Joan Klein Jacobs MIT Presidential Fellowship in 2015, and the Qualcomm Innovation Fellowship in 2016.
