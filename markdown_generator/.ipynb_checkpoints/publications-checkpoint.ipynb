      "2014-04-01\tComparative DC Characteristic Analysis of AlGaN/GaN HEMTs Grown on Si(111) and Sapphire Substrates by MBE\tJournal of Electronic Materials\tA comparative assessment of AlGaN/GaN high-electron-mobility transistors (HEMTs) grown by molecular beam epitaxy on silicon and sapphire substrates has been carried out. Large-area power GaN HEMTs with identical device dimensions were fabricated on both substrates. A thicker AlN buffer layer was used for the GaN HEMT on silicon to achieve similar quality and uniformity of GaN epitaxy for rational comparison with that grown on sapphire. Direct-current analysis and physical characterization were carried out to understand the performance of the devices. Mathematical measurement of the instability of the current–voltage (I–V) characteristic at high applied drain bias was carried out to evaluate the performance of both devices. An improved two-dimensional (2D) analysis of the I–V characteristic was performed from a thermal perspective including appropriate scattering effects on the 2D electron gas mobility. The experimental and analytical studies were correlated to reveal the effects of temperature-sensitive scattering phenomena on the mobility as well as on the I–V characteristic at high drain bias in terms of lattice thermal heating. It is observed that the HEMT on Si has improved stability compared with sapphire due to its weaker scattering phenomena at high drain bias, associated with its thermal conductivity. Simulation of 2D thermal mapping was also carried out to distinguish the hot-spot regions of the devices. The comparable electrical performance of these devices illustrates the viability of AlGaN/GaN HEMTs on Si(111) to achieve low-cost stable devices with better thermal power handling for high-voltage applications.\tP.

      "2015-02-01\tInfluence of Growth Morphology on Electrical and Thermal Modeling of AlGaN/GaN HEMT on Sapphire and Silicon\tSolid-State Electronics\tIn this paper an analytical model has been optimized to represent similar AlGaN/GaN high electron mobility transistor epitaxially grown on different substrates of sapphire and silicon in view of the effect of epitaxial growth driven crystalline quality of buffer on device I–V characteristics. We have observed its important role on electrical and thermal characteristics of the device. Starting with the standard model for AlGaN/GaN HEMT on sapphire, we have employed a novel thermal modeling approach on this metamorphic buffer to derive the device temperature in different epilayers. The optimized mobility model has been enriched with two defect scatterings for their potential role at high lattice temperature. The electrical and thermal characteristics, obtained from present model, are well agreed with the published experimental data and other existing models. We have observed the inclusion of high parasitic resistance to reduce the dissimilarity in I–V characteristics at linear region between experimental and the present model data for the HEMT on Si; which is possibly related to the growth morphology. Perhaps this dissimilarity can be a collaborative effect of various factors like traps, thermal expansion coefficient mismatch and change in critical electric field. Finally, we have observed the significant influence of device dimension on thermal characteristics of the device; which leads to scaling.\tP. Mukhopadhyay, U. Banerjee, A. Bag, S. Ghosh and D.

      "2017-12-01\teeDTLS: Energy-Efficient Datagram Transport Layer Security for the Internet of Things\tIEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)\tIn the fast growing world of the Internet of Things (IoT), security has become a major concern. Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) is considered to be one of the most suited protocols for securing the IoT. However, computation and communication overheads make it very expensive to implement DTLS on resource-constrained IoT sensor nodes. In this work, we profile the energy costs of DTLS 1.3, using experimental models for cryptographic computations and radio-frequency (RF) communications. Based on this analysis, we present eeDTLS, a low-energy variant of DTLS, that provides the same security strength as DTLS, but has lower energy requirements. By employing a combination of packet size reduction and optimized handshake computations, eeDTLS can provide up to 45% energy savings in a typical IoT use case. eeDTLS can be implemented in conjunction with any low-energy IoT RF protocol, and the proposed energy models and protocol optimizations can also be used to improve the energy efficiency of custom IoT security architectures.\tU.

While this makes DTLS an ideal solution for IoT, the associated computational cost makes software-only implementations prohibitively expensive for resource-constrained embedded devices. We address this challenge through three key contributions: reconfigurable cryptographic accelerators enable two orders of magnitude energy savings, a dedicated DTLS engine offloads control flow to hardware reducing program code and memory usage by ~10x. and an on-chip RISC-V core exercises the flexibility of the cryptographic accelerators to demonstrate security applications beyond DTLS.\tU.
