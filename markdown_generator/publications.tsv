2014-04-01	Comparative DC Characteristic Analysis of AlGaN/GaN HEMTs Grown on Si(111) and Sapphire Substrates by MBE	Journal of Electronic Materials	A comparative assessment of AlGaN/GaN high-electron-mobility transistors (HEMTs) grown by molecular beam epitaxy on silicon and sapphire substrates has been carried out. Large-area power GaN HEMTs with identical device dimensions were fabricated on both substrates. A thicker AlN buffer layer was used for the GaN HEMT on silicon to achieve similar quality and uniformity of GaN epitaxy for rational comparison with that grown on sapphire. Direct-current analysis and physical characterization were carried out to understand the performance of the devices. Mathematical measurement of the instability of the current–voltage (I–V) characteristic at high applied drain bias was carried out to evaluate the performance of both devices. An improved two-dimensional (2D) analysis of the I–V characteristic was performed from a thermal perspective including appropriate scattering effects on the 2D electron gas mobility. The experimental and analytical studies were correlated to reveal the effects of temperature-sensitive scattering phenomena on the mobility as well as on the I–V characteristic at high drain bias in terms of lattice thermal heating. It is observed that the HEMT on Si has improved stability compared with sapphire due to its weaker scattering phenomena at high drain bias, associated with its thermal conductivity. Simulation of 2D thermal mapping was also carried out to distinguish the hot-spot regions of the devices. The comparable electrical performance of these devices illustrates the viability of AlGaN/GaN HEMTs on Si(111) to achieve low-cost stable devices with better thermal power handling for high-voltage applications.

2015-02-01	Influence of Growth Morphology on Electrical and Thermal Modeling of AlGaN/GaN HEMT on Sapphire and Silicon	Solid-State Electronics	In this paper an analytical model has been optimized to represent similar AlGaN/GaN high electron mobility transistor epitaxially grown on different substrates of sapphire and silicon in view of the effect of epitaxial growth driven crystalline quality of buffer on device I–V characteristics. We have observed its important role on electrical and thermal characteristics of the device. Starting with the standard model for AlGaN/GaN HEMT on sapphire, we have employed a novel thermal modeling approach on this metamorphic buffer to derive the device temperature in different epilayers. The optimized mobility model has been enriched with two defect scatterings for their potential role at high lattice temperature. The electrical and thermal characteristics, obtained from present model, are well agreed with the published experimental data and other existing models. We have observed the inclusion of high parasitic resistance to reduce the dissimilarity in I–V characteristics at linear region between experimental and the present model data for the HEMT on Si; which is possibly related to the growth morphology. Perhaps this dissimilarity can be a collaborative effect of various factors like traps, thermal expansion coefficient mismatch and change in critical electric field. Finally, we have observed the significant influence of device dimension on thermal characteristics of the device; which leads to scaling.	P. Mukhopadhyay, U. Banerjee, A. Bag, S. Ghosh and D.

2015-12-01	Power-Based Side-Channel Attack for AES Key Extraction on the ATMega328 Microcontroller	MIT Computer Systems Security Report	We demonstrate the extraction of an AES secret key from flash memory on the ATMega328 microcontroller (the microcontroller used on the popular Arduino Genuino/Uno board). We loaded a standard AVR-architecture AES-128 implementation onto the chip and encrypted randomly chosen plaintexts with several different keys. We measured the chip’s power consumption during encryption, correlated observed power consumption with the expected power consumption of the plaintexts with every possible key, and ultimately extracted the 128-bit key used during AES. We describe here our test infrastructure for automated power trace collection, an overview of our correlation attack, sanitization of the traces and stumbling blocks encountered during data collection and analysis, and results of our attack.

2017-12-01	eeDTLS: Energy-Efficient Datagram Transport Layer Security for the Internet of Things	IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)	In the fast growing world of the Internet of Things (IoT), security has become a major concern. Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) is considered to be one of the most suited protocols for securing the IoT. However, computation and communication overheads make it very expensive to implement DTLS on resource-constrained IoT sensor nodes. In this work, we profile the energy costs of DTLS 1.3, using experimental models for cryptographic computations and radio-frequency (RF) communications. Based on this analysis, we present eeDTLS, a low-energy variant of DTLS, that provides the same security strength as DTLS, but has lower energy requirements. By employing a combination of packet size reduction and optimized handshake computations, eeDTLS can provide up to 45% energy savings in a typical IoT use case. eeDTLS can be implemented in conjunction with any low-energy IoT RF protocol, and the proposed energy models and protocol optimizations can also be used to improve the energy efficiency of custom IoT security architectures.

2018-02-01	An Energy-Efficient Reconfigurable DTLS Cryptographic Engine for End-to-End Security in IoT Applications	IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference (ISSCC)	End-to-end security protocols, like Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS), enable the establishment of mutually authenticated confidential channels between edge nodes and the cloud, even in the presence of untrusted and potentially malicious network infrastructure. While this makes DTLS an ideal solution for IoT, the associated computational cost makes software-only implementations prohibitively expensive for resource-constrained embedded devices. We address this challenge through three key contributions: reconfigurable cryptographic accelerators enable two orders of magnitude energy savings, a dedicated DTLS engine offloads control flow to hardware reducing program code and memory usage by ~10x. and an on-chip RISC-V core exercises the flexibility of the cryptographic accelerators to demonstrate security applications beyond DTLS.

2019-02-01	An Energy-Efficient Configurable Lattice Cryptography Processor for the Quantum-Secure Internet of Things	IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference (ISSCC)	Modern public key protocols, such as RSA and elliptic curve cryptography (ECC), will be rendered insecure by Shor’s algorithm when large-scale quantum computers are built. Therefore, cryptographers are working on quantum-resistant algorithms, and lattice-based cryptography has emerged as a prime candidate. However, high computational complexity of these algorithms makes it challenging to implement lattice-based protocols on resource-constrained IoT devices which need to secure data against both present and future adversaries. To address this challenge, we present a lattice cryptography processor with configurable parameters which enables up to two orders of magnitude energy savings and 124k-gate reduction in system area through architectural optimizations. This is also the first ASIC implementation which demonstrates multiple lattice-based protocols proposed in the NIST post-quantum standardization process.	U. Banerjee, A. Pathak and A. P.

2019-05-01	An Energy-Efficient Reconfigurable DTLS Cryptographic Engine for Securing Internet-of-Things Applications	IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits (JSSC)	This paper presents the first hardware implementation of the datagram transport layer security (DTLS) protocol to enable end-to-end security for the Internet of Things (IoT). A key component of this design is a reconfigurable prime field elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) accelerator that is 238x and 9x more energy-efficient compared to software and state-of-the-art hardware, respectively. Our full hardware implementation of the DTLS 1.3 protocol provides 438x improvement in energy-efficiency over software, along with code size and data memory usage as low as 8 and 3 KB, respectively. The cryptographic accelerators are coupled with an on-chip low-power RISC-V processor to benchmark applications beyond DTLS with up to two orders of magnitude energy savings. The test chip, fabricated in 65-nm CMOS, demonstrates hardware-accelerated DTLS sessions while consuming 44.08 μJ/handshake and 0.89 nJ/byte of the encrypted data at 16 MHz and 0.8 V.	U. Banerjee, A.

2019-08-01	Sapphire: A Configurable Crypto-Processor for Post-Quantum Lattice-based Protocols	IACR Transactions on Cryptographic Hardware and Embedded Systems (TCHES)	Public key cryptography protocols, such as RSA and elliptic curve cryptography, will be rendered insecure by Shor’s algorithm when large-scale quantum computers are built. Cryptographers are working on quantum-resistant algorithms, and lattice-based cryptography has emerged as a prime candidate. However, high computational complexity of these algorithms makes it challenging to implement lattice-based protocols on low-power embedded devices. To address this challenge, we present Sapphire – a lattice cryptography processor with configurable parameters. Efficient sampling, with a SHA-3-based PRNG, provides two orders of magnitude energy savings; a single-port RAM-based number theoretic transform memory architecture is proposed, which provides 124k-gate area savings; while a low-power modular arithmetic unit accelerates polynomial computations. Our test chip was fabricated in TSMC 40nm low-power CMOS process, with the Sapphire cryptographic core occupying 0.28 mm2 area consisting of 106k logic gates and 40.25 KB SRAM. Sapphire can be programmed with custom instructions for polynomial arithmetic and sampling, and it is coupled with a low-power RISC-V micro-processor to demonstrate NIST Round 2 lattice-based CCA-secure key encapsulation and signature protocols Frodo, NewHope, qTESLA, CRYSTALS-Kyber and CRYSTALS-Dilithium, achieving up to an order of magnitude improvement in performance and energy-efficiency compared to state-of-the-art hardware implementations. All key building blocks of Sapphire are constant-time and secure against timing and simple power analysis side-channel attacks. We also discuss how masking-based DPA countermeasures can be implemented on the Sapphire core without any changes to the hardware.	U. Banerjee, T. S. Ukyab and A. P.
