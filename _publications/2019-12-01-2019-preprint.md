title: "Sapphire-Sim: Macro-Op-Level Simulator for Ring-LWE and Module-LWE Hardware Acceleration"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2019-12-01-2019-preprint
excerpt: 'This manuscript describes a Python-based open-source cycle-accurate simulator for the Sapphire lattice-crypto processor which can be used to profile the performance of Ring-LWE and Module-LWE algorithms. This allows fast evaluation of lattice-based protocols with varying parameter choices but without any hardware design effort, which is especially important for a fast evolving field such as lattice-based cryptography. The simulator not only reports accurate cycle counts and execution times but also macro-operation-level power and average energy consumption modelled using measurements from the Sapphire test chip at various operating conditions. Detailed description of the custom instructions, simulation options and example code are also provided as reference.'
