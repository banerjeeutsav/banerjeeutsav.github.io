excerpt: 'The current-voltage characteristics of High Electron Mobility Transistors (HEMTs) show significant variations, especially in the saturation region, with change in the substrate on which the HEMT has been grown. One of the most important variations is the gradual decline in the current levels at high drain voltages for HEMTs grown on substrates like sapphire and silicon. This drop in current has been observed to be much higher in sapphire than in silicon, attributed to the effect of self-heating in the device structure. With increasing drain voltage, the channel gets heated up, thus increasing the effects of lattice scattering. A substrate with higher thermal conductivity can dissipate this heat successfully and reduce the scattering, while a substrate with lower thermal conductivity cannot do the same. AlGaN/GaN HEMTs grown on sapphire and Si(111) have been taken as the basis of this study. Existing analytical models include the self-heating effects based on substrate conductance and thickness. The model presented in this work refines the existing model by including the effects of the buffer layer and the temperature variation of thermal conductivity of the layers below the channel. The present model also incorporates the effects of scattering due to material defects on the 2-DEG mobility. The model agrees well with the current-voltage values obtained from published experimental data. The results of our present model show considerable improvement over other available models.'
