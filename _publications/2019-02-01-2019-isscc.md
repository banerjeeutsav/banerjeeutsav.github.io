excerpt: 'Modern public key protocols, such as RSA and elliptic curve cryptography (ECC), will be rendered insecure by Shor’s algorithm when large-scale quantum computers are built. Therefore, cryptographers are working on quantum-resistant algorithms, and lattice-based cryptography has emerged as a prime candidate. However, high computational complexity of these algorithms makes it challenging to implement lattice-based protocols on resource-constrained IoT devices which need to secure data against both present and future adversaries. To address this challenge, we present a lattice cryptography processor with configurable parameters which enables up to two orders of magnitude energy savings and 124k-gate reduction in system area through architectural optimizations. This is also the first ASIC implementation which demonstrates multiple lattice-based protocols proposed in the NIST post-quantum standardization process.'
